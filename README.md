📈 Monte Carlo Simulation for Stock Portfolio Risk Analysis

This project applies Monte Carlo simulation to model the uncertainty and variability of a diversified stock portfolio. It leverages historical data from Yahoo Finance to estimate expected returns, covariance, and simulate future portfolio performance under thousands of random market conditions.

The simulation helps visualize potential growth paths, volatility, and confidence intervals for portfolio valuation over time.

🧠 Key Concepts

This project integrates several key ideas in quantitative finance and data science:

Mean-Variance Optimization: Capturing expected returns and covariance between assets.

Monte Carlo Methods: Simulating random future outcomes to estimate portfolio risk and uncertainty.

Cholesky Decomposition: Generating correlated random shocks to mimic realistic market behavior.

Statistical Confidence Intervals: Visualizing uncertainty through the 5th–95th percentile range.

🧩 Project Overview

The project workflow:

Data Collection

Pulls daily closing prices for selected assets via yfinance
.

Calculates daily returns, mean returns, and covariance matrix.

Portfolio Construction

Assigns random weights across assets (normalized to 1).

Defines initial portfolio value and simulation parameters.

Monte Carlo Simulation

Runs 10,000 simulations over a 100-day horizon.

Applies correlated random shocks using Cholesky decomposition.

Tracks portfolio value paths based on simulated returns.

Visualization & Insights

Plots all simulated portfolio trajectories.

Highlights mean expected growth and 90% confidence interval.
